# belly-button-challenge

This is my submission for Module 14 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

There is one subfodler Static containing app.js, you will also find index.html and samples.json above in this repo.

Running index.html with Live server in VS will give you a a webpage that can be used to display some bacteria data and switch between which subject you want to look at.
